/**
 * Searcher defines a generic graph search and optional backtracking algorithm.
 *
 * The following pseudo code is a recursive representative of the underlying algorithm.
 *
 * let procedure backtrack(root, solution):
 *     if reject(solution, root):
 *         return
 *     solution.append(root)
 *     if accept(solution):
 *         solution.pop()
 *         return
 *     for child âˆˆ children(root):
 *         backtrack(child, solution)
 *
 * Given a node which generates all possible root nodes of the graph and the following procedures...
 *
 *  children(T node): A procedure which returns an iterator of all of the children of "node"
 *  reject(T[] solution, T node): A procedure which returns whether or not the candidate "node" is valid within
 *                                  the context of the given solution.
 *  accept(T[] solution): A procedure which returns whether or not the give solution is complete.
 *
 * ...any graph search may be conducted.
 *
 * Implementors of Searcher are tasked to define children, accept, and optionally reject. If reject is not overriden,
 * then it will always return "false", which is to say that it will never reject, which will transform the backtracking
 * algorithm to a depth-first search.
